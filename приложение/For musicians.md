# Audio Compressor
> Audio compressor is a universal tool for detailed analysis of your sound. It will help to achieve the desired sound with the help of flexible settings: deep, high-frequency, "radio" sound and others.
***
## Parameters of compressor
### Attack
* The __attack__ determines _how fast_ the audio signal is exposed to the compressor, or how long the compression process lasts.
  * If the __attack__ is fast, then the sound is smoother than if the __attack__ was slow.
### Release 
* The __release__ determines _how long_ the compressor clamps a certain sound.
  * If the __release__ is fast, then the sound will be louder, and if the __release__ is long, then the sound will be smoother.
### Threshold
* The __threshold__ _sets the point_ at which audio compression begins.
  * A high __threshold__ provides less compression, a smaller one provides more. But you should be careful, because there is a risk of losing the "energy" of the raw signal.
### Ratio
* The compressor __ratio__ determines the _overall intensity level_ of the compressor.
  * It is better to choose a smaller __ratio__, because in this case the sound will be more harmonious, and the tuning will be fine.
### In & Out Gain
* __Gain__ is the _overall increase in volume_ relative to the level of gain reduction.
  * __Gain__ affects how clean or dirty your sound is. Read more [here](https://producelikeapro.com/blog/audio-gain-volume-gain-staging/)

### Compressor modes
* __SOLO__ mode leaves only one of the compressor levels in operation. Only the parameters corresponding to this level will be valid.
* __MUTE__ silences this compressor level and all the parameters corresponding to it. Unlike bypass, it is not redirected through other channels.
* __BYPASS__ is a bypass channel so that when an emergency level condition occurs, the signal is redirected or blocked entirely.
